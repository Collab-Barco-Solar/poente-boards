## Actions Summary

- [ ] Make sure that the ACS758 is well connected
- [ ] If the original thickness of the copper is less than 2 oz, increase it using a soldered tin layer (try not to cover the vias, they are used to dissipate heat)
- [ ] Make sure that you've connected the cables in the rigth order. The current sensing using ACS758xxx-50U is unidirectional.
