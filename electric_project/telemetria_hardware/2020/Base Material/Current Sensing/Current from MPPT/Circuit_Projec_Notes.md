## Introduction

This circuit needs to be able to read currents from 0 to 40 A theoretically. To accomplish this task we intend to use a hall sensor. The choice of the sensor can be based on the smaller footprint (in comparison with other alternatives, _i.e_ like shunt resistors).

## Utilized Components

### Hall Sensor CI

The hall sensor choosed for this project is the ACS758LCB-050U ([datasheet ACS758](https://github.com/Collab-Barco-Solar/poente-boards/blob/develop/electric_project/telemetria_hardware/2020/Base%20Material/Current%20Sensing/Current%20from%20MPPT/ACS758-Datasheet.pdf)). The ACS758 is an unidirectional hall sensor with an analog output ranging ratiometrically to the voltage supply. From datasheet, the minimal output resistance is 4.7 k<span>&#8486;</span>. Some capital caracteristics can be listed:

1. Care must be taken about trace widths in view of the high current input;
2. Some empirical adjusts will be necessary in view of the 3.3 V supply (not standard in the datasheet);
3. In view of the transient nature of the MPPT output current.

### Output Filter

The filter circuit is a sensitive design and a lot a thought must be putted on. The RC input impedance of the filter can interfere and cause reading errors on the ADC. So, a good practice is to mantain the RC impedance as low as possible (witch can cause high output current from the sensor) and to achieve this goal  a balance must be made between the lowest possible impedance and the lowest dissipated power.

#### ADC Impedance Characteristics

In the ESP32 Datasheet ([ESP32 Datasheet](https://github.com/Collab-Barco-Solar/poente-boards/blob/develop/electric_project/telemetria_hardware/2020/Base%20Material/datasheets/MCU's/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf)) there's no information about the input impedance. So, the approach will be to make the RC filter impedance as low as possible.

#### ACS758 Output Impedance Restrictions

In the [ACS758 datasheet](https://github.com/Collab-Barco-Solar/poente-boards/blob/develop/electric_project/telemetria_hardware/2020/Base%20Material/Current%20Sensing/Current%20from%20MPPT/ACS758-Datasheet.pdf) some impedance parameters are described.

|Symbol                |Value                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------:|
|C<sub>load (max)</sub>| 10 nF                    |
|R<sub>load (min)</sub>| 4.7 k<span>&#8486;</span>|

#### Filter Design Definition

Thus, based on the ACS758 impedance boundaries the filter must have a resistance equal or greater than 4.7 k<span>&#8486;</span> which implies in a limitation in the rate of readings from the ADC (SAR's ADC's). To mantaing this limitation as low as possible, the value of the resistor will be 4.7 k<span>&#8486;</span> and the filter will cut of frequency of 338.63 Hz, achieved using a 100 nF capacitor.
