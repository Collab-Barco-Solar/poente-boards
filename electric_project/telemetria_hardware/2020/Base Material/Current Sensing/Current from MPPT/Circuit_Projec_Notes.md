# Circuit Project Notes

## Introduction
This circuit needs to be able to read currents from 0 to 40 A theoretically. To accomplish this task we intend to use a hall sensor. The choice of the sensor can be based on the smaller footprint (in comparison with other alternatives, _i.e_ like shunt resistors).
