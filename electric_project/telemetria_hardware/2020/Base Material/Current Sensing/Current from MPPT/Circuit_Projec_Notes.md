# Circuit Project Notes

*Author: Jo√£o Agricio Lopes Barbosa*

## Introduction
This circuit needs to be able to read currents from 0 to 40 A theoretically. To accomplish this task we intend to use a hall sensor. The choice of the sensor can be based on the smaller footprint (in comparison with other alternatives, _i.e_ like shunt resistors).

## Utilized Circuits
The hall senser choosed for this project is the ACS758LCB-050U ([datasheet ACS758][https://github.com/Collab-Barco-Solar/poente-boards/blob/develop/electric_project/telemetria_hardware/2020/Base%20Material/Current%20Sensing/Current%20from%20MPPT/ACS758-Datasheet.pdf])
